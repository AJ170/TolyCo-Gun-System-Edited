# TolyCo-Gun-System-Edited

huge thank you to iDatedMyBagel as he helped alot with the editing espically with the math. I also want to thank zSkull162 for their open sourced editor file I used as a template.

this is a edited version of Toly's gun system, this fixes a few issues found in the version its made for and adds a few needed features for more realistic guns.


the release tab contains a unity package with 9 fully animated guns, just follow my youtube video and install my package last or just download the gun.cs script found above and swap it with you current one, DONT FORGET to grab the editor file for it as well or it wont be all pretty and orginized.
